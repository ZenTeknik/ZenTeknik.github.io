## How to Set Up Hugo

### 1. Install Hugo
First, you need to install Hugo on your system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

sudo apt update
sudo apt install hugo
```

**For Arch/Manjaro:**

sudo pacman -Syu hugo
```

### 2. Create a New Hugo Site

hugo new site mysite
```

Navigate to your new site directory:

```bash
cd mysite
```

### 3. Add a Theme
You can add a theme to your Hugo site by cloning it from GitHub. For example:

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```

Configure the theme in `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "ananke"
```

### 4. Create Content
Create a new post using the following command:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

Edit the post using your preferred text editor:

```bash
nano content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

### 5. Run Hugo Server
Start the Hugo server to preview your site:

```bash
hugo server
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to view your site.

## Managing the Hugo Repository

### Commit Changes
If you make any changes to your Hugo site, commit them to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

### Push Changes
Push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Pull Latest Changes
To update your local Hugo site with the latest changes from the repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Permission Denied:** Ensure you have the correct permissions.
  ```bash
  chmod +x hugo
  ```

- **Configuration Errors:** Double-check your `config.toml` file for any syntax errors.
